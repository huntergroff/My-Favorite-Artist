## Summary

We have designed a website that allows the user to search for a musical artist and find different info about the artist. We also provided
some popular artists under the "top searches" drop down menu for ease of access. At the
bottom of the website there are two scrollable menus that display the top 10 songs the artist has been involved with as well as popular
albums that the artist is on. It is important to note that the songs menu includes songs that an artist is featured in or produced as well as the songs that they have wrote or performed.
The menu with the top 10 songs also contains links to the lyrics and audio for each song on genius.com so that the user
can have easy access to the information. In the center of the page there is a large summary of the artist's life and history in the music
industry. Above this summary, the artist's name and aliases are displayed. On the left side, under the artist picture, we have social media links to the artist's Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Genius, and Deezer pages.
Finally, the artist picture is clickable, and when clicked, will change the picture to another image of the artist.


Please note that previewing the site in glitch's "Next to The Code" view does not provide the full experience, because external links
do not function in this view. Please visit our website at the link above!
